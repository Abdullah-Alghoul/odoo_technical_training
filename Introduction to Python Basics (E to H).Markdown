## E(1) Functions (Procedures)
 
These  are reusable pieces of programs. They allows us  to give a name and encapsulate a block of statements*(codes)*,  allowing us to run that block using the specified name anywhere in the program and any number of times. 

The function concept is probably the most important building block of any non-trivial software (in any programming language).

Functions are defined using the __def__ keyword. After this keyword comes an identifier
name for the function, followed by a pair of __parentheses__ which may enclose some names of variables, and by the __final colon__ that ends the line. 
Next follows the block of statements that are part of this function. 

Example:
```python
    def employee():
        """Return profile of an an employee"""
        pass # But this does nothing now.
```
From the block of codes, we define a function called __employee__ using the syntax as explained above. This function takes no *parameters (some people called this arguments, but the real name is parameter)* and hence there are no variables declared in the parentheses.

Parameter is an input variable to functions or procedure definition, that gets an actual value(argument) at execution time. 

They are just input to the function so that we can pass in different values to it and get back corresponding results. Notice that we can call the same function twice which means we do not have to write the same code again.

## E(2) Function Parameters
A function can take zero or as many parametes as needed, which value(s) would be supplied to the function at run time(during execution), the function can then do  something using those values. 

These parameters are just like regular variables except that thier values were defined when we call the function and are already assigned values when the function runs.

Parameters are specified within the pair of parentheses in the function definition, separated by commas. When we call the function, we supply the values in the same way. 

__Note the terminology used - the name of variables given in the function definition are called parameters whereas the values you supply in the function call are called arguments.__

Example:

```python
    # definition of a function maximum.py
    def maximum(a, b):
        """Return the greater number between a and b"""
        if a > b:
            print a, 'is greater than', b
        elif a == b:
            print a, 'and b are equal'
        else:
            print b, 'is greater than', a
            
            
    # Now let us call the our maximum function, by passing value to it directly.
    
    maximum(6, 4) # -> 6 'is greater than', 4
    
    # we can also pass variable as an arguments, which is what we will do almost everytime.
    x = 15
    y = 17
    arguments(x, y) # -> 17, 'is greater than', 15
```
From the above code block, we define a function called maximum that accept  two posotional arguments , i.e parameter a and b . 
We then  find out the greater number using a simple __if..else__ statement and then print the bigger number.

## E(3) Local Variables
When ever  we declared any variable inside a function definition, such variable has no relationship with other variable of the same name declared  outside the function block, i.e. variable names are local to the function. 

This is called the __scope of the variable__. All variables have the
scope of the block they are declared in, starting from the point of definition of the name.

```python
    # employee.py
    
    name = 'babatope ajepe'
    
    def employee(name):
        """Return profile of an an employee"""
        print 'name is', name
        name = 'john doe'
        print 'name is now change to', name
        
        # output
        employee(name) # -> name is babatope ajepe
                       # -> name is now changed to john doe
         print name    # -> babatope ajepe 

```
The first time that we print the value of the name __name__ with the first line in the functionâ€™s body/block, Python uses the value of the parameter declared in the main block, above the function definition.

Next, we assign the value 'john doe' to __name__ . The variable name __name__ is local to our function. 
So, when we change the value of __name__ in the function, the __name__ defined in the main block remains unaffected.

The last print statement display the value of __name__ as defined in the main block(global scope), confirming that it is actually unaffected by the local assignment within the previously called function.

## E(4) The global statement

If we want to re-assign or change the value to a __name__ declared at the top level of the program, with our __employee__ function. We need to tell Python that the variable is not local, but it is __global__. 

We can do this using the __global statement__. Practically, It is impossible to re-assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the use global statement. Using the global statement makes it amply clear that the variable is defined in an outermost block.

Example: 
```python 
 # employee.py

    name = 'babatope ajepe'

    def employee(name):
        """Return profile of an an employee"""
        global name  # referencing the global name outside the employee scope.
        print 'name is', name
        name = 'john doe'
        print 'name is now change to', name

        # output
        employee(name) # -> name is babatope ajepe
                       # -> name is now changed to john doe
         print name    # -> john doe
```

The use of the __global__ statement, tells Python that the variable __name__  is a global variable i.e (outside the local scope) hence, when we re-assign a value to __name__ inside the employee function*(local scope)*, that change the value of __name__ in the global scope.

## E(5) Default Argument Values

For some functions, we may want to make some parameters optional and use default values in case the user does not want to provide values for them. 
This is done with the help of default argument values. we can set default argument values for parameters by appending to the parameter name in the function definition the assignment operator __( = )__ followed by the default value.
__Note that the default argument value should be a constant. More precisely, the default argument value should be immutable.__ 

```python 
    def warning(message, times=1):
        """warn a friend about danger ahead, in number of times."""
        print message * times
        
    shout('Don't play with python, it's very dangerous') # -> Don't play with python, it's very dangerous
    
    shout('Don't play with python, it's very dangerous', 2) # -> Don't play with python, it's very dangerous  
                                                            # -> Don't play with python, it's very dangerous 
```
