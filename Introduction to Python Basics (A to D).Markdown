Python is a simple to write and understand language. Reading Python feels like reading English. In fact a ... iterated that python feels like writing pseudocodes. Because of some of these qualities of python it recently, in a survey done by Stackoverflow overtook languages like Php as the third most preferred language by developers only trailing the likes of javaScript and PhP. In this section of python baics, we will look at some of the qualoities of the language which includes but are not limited to Extensibility, FLOOS etc. 

Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both simple and powerful. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language you are programming in.

The official introduction to Python is:
Python  is  an  easy  to  learn,  powerful  programming  language.  It  has
efficient  high-level  data  structures  and  a  simple  but  effective  approach
to  object-oriented  programming.  Python’s  elegant  syntax  and  dynamic
typing,  together  with  its  interpreted  nature,  make  it  an  ideal  language
for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
platforms.

*Simple
Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels
almost like reading English, although very strict English! This pseudo-code nature
of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution

As  you  will  see,  Python  is  extremely  easy  to  get  started  with.  Python  has  an
extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.
Free and Open Source
Python is an example of a 

*FLOSS

 terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make
